/** What are the arrow functions? and why?
 * They are anonymous functions with their own unique syntax.
 * Simpler way to write function expression.
 * `this` derives its value from enclosing lexical scope.
 * Arrow functions are not a replacement for regular functions.
 * 
 * Why?
 * Readability with shorter syntax
 * 
 * Side Effects?
 * Behavior of this keyword
 * No arguments object (we used recently to access all passed args)
