    "this property can be disadvantageous in some situations. For example, the person using the sort client might be surprised to realize that it takes about as long to run selection sort for an array that is already in order or for an array with all keys equal as it does for a randomly-ordered array\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data movement is minimal\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the N exchanges changes the value of two array entries, so selection sort uses N exchangesâ€”the number of array accesses is a linear function of the array size. None of the other sorting algorithms that we consider have this property (most involve linearithmic or quadratic growth)."
